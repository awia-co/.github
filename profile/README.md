# Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## We're Awia

And work can be exhausting. 

Especially when you have to manually do tasks that could be automated, or made simpler. 

We think we get that, and we're working to make work just a bit better for all of us.

## We'd love your help.

1. Let us know how you think we can make work better. 
2. Help us make work better by contributing to our projects. It's not enough, but one large contribution adds you to our GitHub Sponsors list on the project you contribute to.
3. Call us out when we're not doing it. We have GitHub discussions for each project we're working on. YELL, Scream, and Cry at us to do the right thing if we're not.

## Thank you!!
